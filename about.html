<h2>About</h2>

I have over ten years industry experience working for high profile,
large-scale defence and civilian software and systems development.

From an academic perspective, I have completed the Masters of Business and Technology program, and was awarded an
undergraduate scholarship to study at University of Technology, Sydney where I maintained consistently high grades
represented by receiving multiple awards for academic excellence throughout my undergraduate studies. I was also
awarded an innovation award for my Capstone (an honours-level equivalent) project.

I also contribute to open source projects in leadership roles such as being the lead maintainer for a Drupal module
and developing several projects on GitHub. I have also presented at leading data and tech conferences.

My extensive technical and analytical background, combined with my strategic and tactical perspectives and ability
to forge collaborative relationships with valued business partners makes me a valuable addition to a high-performing team.
