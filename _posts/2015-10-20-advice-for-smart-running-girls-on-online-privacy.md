So not to be a 'creepy Steve'  a la [Smart Girl's Guide to Online Privacy](https://www.nostarch.com/smartgirlsguide) (fantastic read!), but another piece of advice I'd leave for the privacy-conscious who post their photos with their running bib's on social media (especially dating sites).

If you go to running competition results pages, like the one for the [Sydney Blackmores Running Festival](http://www.multisportaustralia.com.au/Home/QuickResults?clientId=1&raceId=1364) (not just limited to this competition - pretty much all running events use similar results websites), you'll see that all you need to find out someone's name, age and in some cases suburb is their bib number... So as always be wary of what you post online!
