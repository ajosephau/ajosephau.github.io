I was trying to download Company of Heroes for mac osx, and having a slow Internet :/ meant the app download fails with "an error occurred".

But why doesn't the "restart" button work?!? I found going to Finder, attempting to cancel the download opens up the App Store asking you to cancel or continue the download. And continuing seems to work!!
