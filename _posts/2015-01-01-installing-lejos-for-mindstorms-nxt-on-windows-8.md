So I had to deviate a little from the installation instructions to get LeJOS working on Windows 8, especially on a 64 bit operating system:

1.  Install a 32-bit version (ie x86) of Java JDK from the Oracle website:
    1.  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
2.  Install the RobotC NXT drivers from the RobotC site, more than likely the 64bit version:
    1.  http://www.robotc.net/download/lego/
3.  Install the latest LeJOS .exe version of the setup program from SourceforgeÂ and the JDK and the drivers should be detected automatically!
    1.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/lejos/files/lejos-NXJ/

So far it's worked for me on a Surface Pro 3 and a Macbook Pro.
