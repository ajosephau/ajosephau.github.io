Firstly you'll need to install the UUID Features (https://drupal.org/project/uuid\_features) , Features (https://drupal.org/project/features) and UUID (https://drupal.org/project/uuid) modules.

Once all those modules are enabled, go to example.com/admin/config/content/uuid\_features (or on your administration menu go to Administration --> Content Authoring --> UUID Features Integration, and under "Exportable Taxonomy term bundles" check the boxes for the relevant taxonomy terms.

Go to your features export page at example.com/admin/structure/features/ (or on your administration menu go to Administration --> Structure --> Features), create/recreate the feature and you'll see "Taxonomy Terms" listed.

Happy exporting!!
