So I use Jaycar's Mini DisplayPort to HDMI/DisplayPort/DVI converter (available at http://www.jaycar.com.au/productView.asp?ID=WQ7427) to connect my MacBook Pro to my TV. So getting the display to work is easy (set the TV to receive video from whichever HDMI port the laptop is connected to)... but getting audio to go out of the TV instead of the MacBook Pro?

1.  Go to System Preferences.
2.  Click "Sound"
3.  Click "Output"
4.  And select the display.

And congratulations :-)!
