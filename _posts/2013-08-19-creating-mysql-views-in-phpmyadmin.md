I saw lots of various answers to this question, but I thought I might share a quick and easy way of doing this I stumbled upon!

1.  Select your database
2.  Click on the SQL tab and run the query you want to power your view
3.  Under "query results operations", select "create view". You will see your brand new view if you click on the "structure" tab for the database
