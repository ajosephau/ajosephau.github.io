Being a little too eager, I upgraded my iPhone to the latest iOS 7 version.... but had issues trying to sync my music collection.... basically I would sync my music and somewhere into the process it would stop unexpectedly, saying "Cancelling sync".

I found that I had some songs had text in the comments field and characters like "「" and "」" - after removing them all my songs synchronised perfectly!
