So one question I got asked was how do we stay motivated while doing open source programming:

> We never tire of tips to stay motivated, because we get demotivated quite easily. What are your tips?

I thought I might write down three tips I have for staying motivated:

# Find your why

From Simon Sinek who quite literally book on [Finding your why](https://simonsinek.com/stories/learn-simons-simple-exercise-for-finding-your-why/)... finding your reason or purpose for contributing to open source. For me, it was:
- a sense of giving back to a community that I take so much from, and
- a chance to grow my skills outside of my work.

that keeps me motivated.

# Find your people

Finding people with similar motivations can also help with staying motivated and encouraged. They're the ones who can keep you motivated and help you when you lose your spitit. Because let's face it, it does happen.

# Make work comfortable

Sometimes work (and other tasks) can be boring and unenjoyable. Automating the boring bits, sitting down to work in a comfortable environment or finding the best times to do boring tasks can help motivation. Sometimes even a change in environment or a deadline can be encouraging.


Hope this helps out a fellow traveller ☺️.
