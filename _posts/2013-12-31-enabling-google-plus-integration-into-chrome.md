I don't know if you have ever wanted to get google plus integration into Google Chrome (so this works for [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com.au/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html) and for [Chromium](http://www.freesmug.org/chromium)) where you can see your google plus notifications and quickly access gmail and the like....

It's rather simple!

*   Go to Properties in Google Chrome.
*   Click "Show Advanced Settings"
*   Enable "Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar".

If you have some versions of Chrome Canary or Chromium, you'll need to go to "chrome://flags" and enable "Enable Instant Extended API" and "Enable local first-load NTP in Instant Extended."

Happy new year!!
