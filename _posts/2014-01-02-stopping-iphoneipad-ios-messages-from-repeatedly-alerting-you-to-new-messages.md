So a big pain for me in iOS was how whenever I'd get a text message/iMessage it will keep on beeping at me.... Well I found a way to stop this from happening by turning off "Repeat Alerts" in the Notification Settings for Messages app.

How do you get there?

*   Go to the Settings App.
*   Select "Notification Centre".
*   Select "Messages".
*   Scroll down until you see "Repeat Alerts".

Here's a screen shot to show where it is :-).
